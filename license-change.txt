Hi,

I was looking for a project to fill my spare time and I ended up with
the idea of porting some (allegro) games to Linux.

I'm a crazy guy who likes porting and then testing and then coding again
more then just playing (although I sometimes enjoy just playing) as such
  I've not yet targeted a specific game to port I just want to expand
the collection of games available for Linux and enjoy myself at the same
time.

For more on me see:
http://home.versatel.nl/jwrdegoede/

I'm most famous for xmame the Unix port of MAME I guess.

Worminator sounds like an excellent candidate for my next project. It
looks like (I only have Linux so I haven't tried it yet) a very fun game!

As I understand it (this is a bit unclear on the homepage) Worminator3
is win32 only and thus probably no longer uses allegro or?

Anyways if possible I would like todo a Linux port. I've tried to
download the version 1 source but I had to register for that. Can you
send me a copy of the version 1 source or preferably the version 3 one?

And just as important as having access to the source, under what
conditions (license) can I use it? I've burned myself working on less
then 100% free software before and I would like to avoid that this time.
For the definition of freesoftware see:
www.gnu.org

Any free license will do for me. For the artwork and sounds you could
use a more artwork and sounds oriented license like the Creative Commons
licenses.


Thanks & Regards,

Hans

Hey Hans de Goede, aight so I still have to speak to Dave and the two other
guys but... personally, I think it would be *super* cool to have you do a
Linux port. I don't think we specifically plastered a license on the game, but
we made the source code available and I don't think it'll be any problem to
have you work on a Linux port. 

I believe even the latest version of the game still uses Allegro, just we never
tried to compile on Linux/don't know if there are any compatibility
issues/never put any time into trying to compile on Linux, and that's why its
Win32 only :-) I'm not sure if there's actually any specific Win32 code. 


In any case, I'll email Dave today and forward him this, he did the
programming. You might not get a response right away, we're both very busy with
the beginning of the semester and I'll be out-of-town for the next week... but
if you don't hear from either one of us within a week, make sure to email me
again, I think it'd be really great for you to do a Linux port!

 - Keith

First of all I'm very happy to hear that you like the idea, but I really 
must insist on slapping a clear License (say GPL for example) on the 
sources. I plan on providing Linux binaries, but its _really_ a show 
stopper for me if I can't distribute the sources and allow others to 
freely redistribute both binaries and sources including modified 
versions. I realise this is a _lot_ to ask, and I can only hope you (the 
team) are willing to release the source under such a license.

For the artwork (and levels) the story is quite different. A license 
allowing free redistribution of those is enough. I can fully agree if 
you don't want others to (re)distribute modified versions of your 
artwork (and levels).

If thats true that would be great I'm pretty sure it won't compile out 
of the box, but its a good start. Otherwise if its all directx for 
example I might take a shot too, but it will be much harder to port.

I understand that an answer may take some time, thanks for the quick 
respons sofar.

Awesome, I see no problem with GPL for everything, it doesn't bother me if
people change artwork and we've already made the source code available for
download so why not GPL? 

Just need to run that by Dave (hey Dave! thoughts? GPL OK with you?)

You should be hearing from Dave if you havn't already, he said it might take
him a few days to get the source code cleaned up and ready for you.

  Dear Hans,
   
  I understand that you are interested in creating a Linux port of Worminator
  3. I have attatched the source code for the latest build I have of the game
  to this e-mail.  In order to test it, you need to download the data file and
  the maps from our website (I couldn't send everything because the attatchment
  would have been around 8 megs).
   
  Once you compile the executable, make sure that the wormdata.dat file is
  present as well as the maps folder.  If not, the game will probabaly crash.
   
  You are free to port this to linux and release it if you like, the game is
  freeware and I don't mind it being publically available.  Good luck with your
  project, I hope you can make sense of this source code.  I wrote it ages ago
  now, and there are quite a few poorly done portions.  If you need any help,
  let me know.  The game is still Allegro based, this new version just uses
  Winallegro.  There shouldnt be alot that you have to change to get it running
  under Linux (hopefully).
   
  Keep me posted as to your progress.  Good luck.
   
  -David Layne

Making it publically available was the plan :) Could you ellaborate on 
the freeware part? I wonder did Keith forward my reply to him about the 
licensing? I'll include it below for reference.

Anyways freeware is a bit of an ambigious term, software which is free 
to download, but comes without any source is often called freeware. Do 
you mean that the data files and the source are publicdomain, iow anyone 
can do with it what they want (including closed source commercial 
spinoffs) ?

Public Domain would be fine with me, as that is a legally well defined 
term, a more restrictive but opensource License like GPL would be fine too.

I'm sorry that I've keep nagging about the License part, but I've burned 
myself in the past by spending (lots of) freetime on projects without a 
proper license.

Good to hear that its all allegro, that should indeed make the port 
relativly easy. As for poorly done code I'm a computerscience teacher, 
I've seen my part of poorly done code.

I most certainly will,

Thanks again,

  Good call, thats my fault.  I forgot that my latest build had some graphical
  changes in the data file.  I'm attatching the newest data file.  Glad the
  project is going well.  I will release a new version of worminator 3 soon
  with the new data file included.  The life essence things were added to make
  the game a little easier, alot of the weaker enemies drop them now and they
  heal you when you collect them.
   
  BTW, feel free to GPL the code, I was planning on publically releasing it
  anyway but I kept holding back because I was planning on adding a few more
  things to it and I just never got around to it.  Just leave me listed as the
  original author of the code and yourself as the developer of the linux port
  and everything should be fine.
